### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This helps to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

* Correlation Matrix
The correlation matrix shows the relationship between customer churn and other variables. Here are the key findings:

* Age Correlation with Churn: -13%
Older customers tend to churn slightly less than younger customers.

* Service Usage Correlation with Churn: 4%
A slight positive correlation indicates that more service usage is associated with a marginal increase in churn likelihood.

* Frequent Flyer Correlation with Churn: -6%
Frequent flyers are slightly less likely to churn compared to non-frequent flyers.

* Income Level Correlation with Churn: 14%
Higher income is positively correlated with a higher likelihood of churn.

* Social Media Sync Correlation with Churn: 7%
Customers who have their accounts synced to social media have a slightly higher churn rate.

* Hotel Booking Correlation with Churn: -21%
Customers who booked hotels through the company's services are significantly less likely to churn.

### predictive analysis
was conducted to determine the accuracy of a churn prediction model using a confusion matrix.

* Model Performance Metrics
Accuracy: 27%
The model correctly predicted customer churn only 27% of the time, indicating a need for model improvement.

* Precision: 24%
Out of all customers predicted to churn, only 24% actually did, showing a high rate of false positives.

* Recall: 99%
The model identified 99% of actual churned customers, but this high recall is at the expense of precision.

## DATA VISUALIZATION


## INSIGHTS
 * High Churn Rate Among Higher Income Customers: Higher income customers tend to churn more, possibly due to their greater number of alternatives. This group may seek higher value or more personalized services.

* Significant Impact of Hotel Booking on Churn: Customers who book hotels through the company are less likely to churn, suggesting that these bookings enhance customer loyalty.

* Frequent Flyers Are Loyal: Frequent flyers are less likely to churn, indicating they value the services provided by the company.

* Service Usage and Churn: There is a slight increase in churn with more service usage, which could imply dissatisfaction with services or unmet expectations.

* Social Media Sync and Churn: Accounts synced to social media show a slightly higher churn rate, potentially indicating that these customers are more exposed to competitorsâ€™ promotions or reviews.

* Young Customers and Churn: Younger customers have a higher churn rate, possibly due to less brand loyalty and more flexibility in switching services.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
* Enhance Value for High Income Customers: Develop premium services or loyalty programs tailored to high-income customers to reduce their churn rate.

* Promote Hotel Booking Services: Strengthen and promote hotel booking services to increase customer retention. Consider offering exclusive deals or discounts for repeat customers.

* Focus on Frequent Flyers: Continue to nurture and reward frequent flyers with benefits and personalized experiences to maintain their loyalty.

* Improve Service Quality and Expectations Management: Investigate why customers using more services are slightly more likely to churn. Enhance service quality and set clear expectations to reduce churn.

* Leverage Social Media Engagement: Since customers with social media-synced accounts are more prone to churn, improve social media engagement by offering exclusive promotions and engaging content.

* Engage Younger Customers: Develop strategies to engage younger customers, such as offering trendy, budget-friendly packages or engaging them through social media campaigns.

* Model Improvement: The current churn prediction model is not very accurate. Enhance the model by including more relevant features, using different algorithms, and improving data quality.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can better understand its customer base, enhance customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rates, thereby driving growth and sustainability.
